Binary Arithmetic Coding


This file takes as input binary data (image, text, audio etc.), reads the data bit by bit and encodes
the data using QM Coding.

Even though this is not the actual way in which QM coding is done, the code is simple to understand 
the concepts of QM Coding.

To execute this file, simply run main.cpp and follow instructions on the screen.
